## You're a bus captain!

Hey {{first_name}},

Thanks for volunteering to be a bus captain! We know most people just want to hop on &amp; off the bus, but coordinating busses isn't that easy. Thanks to you, this bus to {{hackathon_name}} can be a success!

We've provided a portal to view all bus passengers for your bus, as well as provide important information about being a captain. <strong>Please take a look!</strong>

<a href="{{bus_captain_url}}" class="button">Bus List Â»</a><br />
<small><i>Link not working? Go to {{bus_captain_url}}</i></small>

This will be the central source of truth for passengers &amp; bus information, in addition to anything you hear from our travel director.

This also means your <strong>name, email, and phone number</strong> are visible to everyone riding the bus. This information is taken straight from your {{hackathon_name}} application, so please make sure it is up to date! You can check this at [{{apply_url}}]({{apply_url}})

Again, thank you so much for being a bus captain! If you have any questions at all, feel free to reach out. We can't wait to see you at {{hackathon_name}}!
