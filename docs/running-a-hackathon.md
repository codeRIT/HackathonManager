## Timeline of a hackathon

HackathonManager helps with every step along the way.

1. (many months before) -- Website goes up advertising event coming soon
2. (months before) -- Attendee applications open
3. (weeks to month before) -- Acceptance emails go out, RSVPs begin, bus sign-ups begin
4. (weeks leading up to event) -- Emails to communicate logistics as needed
5. (day-of event) -- Check-in attendees as they arrive at the venue
6. (during- and post-event) -- Emails for communication as needed
7. (post-event) -- Analyze data to observe trends to act on for next year (pre-generated graphs or custom queries via SQL)
