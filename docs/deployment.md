HackathonManager supports two platforms out of the box:

- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) — Easiest & quickest way that requires little server knowledge, however isn't cheap (free tier not recommended)
- [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/) — A free alternative to Heroku, runs on your own virtual machine
- [OKD/OpenShift](https://www.okd.io) — "Enterprise Kubernetes for Developers" packaged with a useful management UI + tooling

See the platform-specific guides [on the Wiki](https://github.com/codeRIT/hackathon_manager/wiki) to get started!

HackathonManager can also be deployed the same as any other Rails app, however this is **not** natively supported and will require you to fork this repo to integrate code changes.
